# Ecosystem

The ecosytem is simple, i have created green dots which are the plants in my scene, i have created black dots which are my herbivores that move around finding plants to consume and then i have the big red dots which are my predators that chase after the herbivores to consume. I have also created an energy system, herbivores have a starting energy of 100 and predators of 200, whenever a herbivore consumes a plant their energy goes up and whenever a predator consumes a herbivore their energy will also go up, meanwhile their energy is also constantly going down if they are moving around a lot and not consuming anything eventually they will die or go to rest which in the scene will be them disappearing. i have also kept everything bound within the screen, made the plants constantly regenerate so if the predators die out and the herbivores stay alive they will constantly keep having plants to eat, but if all the herbivores die out and only the predators are left then the predators will eventually die out aswell.
